### The right tool for the job
Over the past ten or so years I used to pick what seemed to be the best tool for building a site. Most of the times the solution was Joomla on top of a VPS (Virtual Private Server) but also WordPress was something that I had to deal with quite often. The interesting part was always the VPS, as that was something I personally had to keep in top shape (meaning updates for: the OS, the PHP, the MySQl, the NGINX, and anything else was used...). Nightmare on wax...
